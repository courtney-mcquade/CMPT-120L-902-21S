Courtney McQuade's Website 

Description 
    For my final project in Introduction to Programming (CMPT 120-902) I created a web page all about myself. The web page uses flask, html and python to run a web page on a local host. This project manages multiple web pages and hosts static content on the webpage using basic HTML and Flask Web Server. On the website, you can find a description about me, my resume, some of my favorite music, and contact information. 

Getting Started and Executing the Program 

    How to Run the Program
